      "question": "Which of the following is a valid way to create a decorator in Python?",
      "options": [
        "Using a class with `__call__` method",
        "Using a function that returns a function",
        "Both A and B",

      "question": "What does the `*args` and `**kwargs` syntax represent in a function definition?",
      "options": [
        "It allows a function to accept an arbitrary number of positional and keyword arguments, respectively.",
        "It is used for defining default argument values.",
        "It is used for type hinting.",
        "It is a syntax error."

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of `__slots__` in a Python class?",
      "options": [
        "To define instance attributes with default values.",
        "To optimize memory usage by preventing the creation of `__dict__` for instances.",
        "To create class-level variables.",
        "To define a custom string representation for objects."

  "article_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Explain the concept of generators in Python and their advantages.",
      "answer": "Generators are functions that return an iterator and are created using the `yield` keyword. They allow for lazy evaluation, generating values on the fly, which saves memory and improves performance for large datasets."

  "coding_questions": [
    {
      "question": "Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers.",
      "code_snippet": "def get_even_numbers(numbers):\n    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]",
      "explanation": "This function uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `numbers`. For each `num` in the list, it checks if `num` is divisible by 2 (i.e., even) using the modulo operator (`%`). If the condition is true, the number is included in the new list that is returned."
